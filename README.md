# Magento 2 & React Case Study

## Introduction
This project began as a case study on **Magento 2**—exploring its modules, patches, and data/product insertion. Over time, it evolved into a comprehensive study of **modern frontend development** using **React, TailwindCSS, Apollo Client, and GraphQL**, including handling **CORS issues** and implementing a **GraphQL-based API integration**.

## Technologies Used
- **Magento 2**: Backend e-commerce framework
- **React**: Frontend framework for a dynamic UI
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first styling approach
- **Apollo Client**: GraphQL state management for React
- **GraphQL**: API query language for Magento data retrieval
- **CORS Proxy**: Middleware to bypass request errors in development

## Magento 2 Backend Case Study
### 1. Modules & Patches
- Implemented **custom modules** for product management.
- Applied **Magento patches** to enhance stability.
- Explored **Magento's admin panel** for configuration changes.

### 2. Data & Product Insertion
- Programmatically inserted products into **Magento 2 database**.
- Examined Magento’s **catalog and attribute management**.
- Utilized Magento’s **Admin UI and CLI tools**.

### 3. Usage of Mysql CLI
- Efficently used mysql CLI to modify said data patches when at some point became problematic.
- Further Refined and increased knowledge in sql queries to debug and or delete items from Database.
- Modified Admin User/s using said knowledge in sql queries

## Frontend Overhaul with React
### 1. Migrating UI to React
- Developed a **React-based shop interface**.
- Used **TailwindCSS** for styling and UI components.

### 2. Handling CORS Issues
- Faced **CORS restrictions** when making GraphQL API calls.
- Implemented a **proxy in React** to bypass CORS errors in development.

## GraphQL Integration
### 1. Fetching Magento Data via GraphQL
- Utilized **Magento’s /graphql endpoint** to retrieve product data.
- Constructed **GraphQL queries** for fetching product listings, categories, and details.

### 2. Apollo Client for State Management
- Integrated **Apollo Client** in React to cache and manage GraphQL data.
- Improved performance with **query batching and caching strategies**.

## Conclusion
This case study provided an extensive exploration of **Magento 2 backend development, React frontend implementation, and GraphQL API integration**. It tackled common challenges like **CORS handling, efficient state management, and seamless product retrieval** from the Magento backend.

### Next Steps
- Enhancing **authentication & user management**.
- Implementing **real-time updates** with GraphQL subscriptions.
- Further refine **performance optimizations**.
